<h1>Programmer</h1>
<hr>
<p>A <strong>programmer</strong> is someone who writes/creates computer software or applications generally by providing instructions (commonly through the use of a specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language ">programming language</a>) to the computer or by configuring already existing code (such as a framework or existing code base). Most programmers have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Structured Query Language (SQL), Perl, Extensible Markup Language (XML), PHP, HTML, C, C++ and Java</p>
<h1>Terminology</h1>
<hr>
<p>There is no industry-wide standard terminology, so "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer">programmer</a>" and "software engineer" might refer to the same role at different companies. Most typically, someone with a job title of "programmer" or "software developer" might focus on implementing a detailed specification into computer code, fixing bugs, and performing code reviews. They might have a degree in computer science, an associate degree, or might be self-taught or attended a programming boot camp.</p>
<h3><strong>Types of software</strong></h3>
<p>Programming editors, also known as source code editors, are text editors that are specifically designed for programmers or developers to write the source code of an application or a program. Most of these editors include features useful for programmers, which may include color syntax highlighting, auto indentation, auto-complete, bracket matching, syntax check, and allows plug-ins. These features aid the users during coding, debugging and testing.</p>
<h2>Globalization</h2>

<div style="width: 700px; background-color: rgb(81, 65, 155); height: 50px; position: absolute; left: 600;">The examples and perspective in this section deal <strong>primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject.</strong>

<h3>Market changes in the US</h3>
<p>After the crash of the dot-com bubble (1999â€“2001) and the Great Recession (2008), many U.S. programmers were left without work or with lower wages.[19][20] In addition, enrollment in computer-related degrees and other STEM degrees (STEM attrition)[21] in the US has been dropping for years, especially for women,
    which, according to Beaubouef and Mason,[23] could be attributed to a lack of general interest in science and mathematics and also out of an apparent fear that programming will be subject to the same pressures as manufacturing and agriculture careers.Though the distinction is somewhat ambiguous, software developers engage in a wider array of aspects of application development and are generally higher skilled than programmers, making outsourcing less of a risk.[29][30] Another reason for the decline for programmers is their skills are being merged with other professions, such as developers,
    as employers increase the requirements for a position over time. Then there is the additional concern that recent advances in artificial intelligence might impact the demand for future generations of Software professions.
