<h1>Programmer</h1>
<hr>
<p>A <strong>programmer</strong> is someone who writes/creates computer software or applications generally by providing instructions (commonly through the use of a specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language ">programming language</a>) to the computer or by configuring already existing code (such as a framework or existing code base). Most programmers have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Structured Query Language (SQL), Perl, Extensible Markup Language (XML), PHP, HTML, C, C++ and Java</p>
<h1>Terminology</h1>
<hr>
<p>There is no industry-wide standard terminology, so "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer">programmer</a>" and "software engineer" might refer to the same role at different companies. Most typically, someone with a job title of "programmer" or "software developer" might focus on implementing a detailed specification into computer code, fixing bugs, and performing code reviews. They might have a degree in computer science, an associate degree, or might be self-taught or attended a programming boot camp.</p>
<h3><strong>Types of software</strong></h3>
<p>Programming editors, also known as source code editors, are text editors that are specifically designed for programmers or developers to write the source code of an application or a program. Most of these editors include features useful for programmers, which may include color syntax highlighting, auto indentation, auto-complete, bracket matching, syntax check, and allows plug-ins. These features aid the users during coding, debugging and testing.</p>
